A neighbor of a Joy Project member runs his own business flipping houses in Lexington, KY.  His business has been struggling as the real estate industry tries to rebound.  In the spring of 2013 he was working on flipping a house and was way behind on the timeline.  The Joy Project caught wind of his situation and rounded up 15 amazing people to volunteer their time and skills to help him make up lost time on his current house flip. He was able to complete his flip on time and the house is now for sale. His business is bouncing back. He was overwhelmed with joy and gratefulness. He couldnâ€™t stop telling the volunteers how much this meant to him. We were as encouraged by him as he was encouraged by the team of volunteers. Thank you to everyone who helped out!
