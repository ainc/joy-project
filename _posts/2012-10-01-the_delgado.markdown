In the Fall of 2012  a hard working single mother of seven children discovered she was 7 months pregnant with her 8th child. After being diagnosed with preeclampsia and hospitalized, the mother was forced to quit her job. Financial strains grew. Living conditions were already rough, with only 2 of the 3 rooms usable and only 2 beds. Through numerous volunteers and donations, The Joy Project was able to assist the family with immediate needs by investing in bunk beds, baby supplies, and additional furniture. Several work days later, all 3 bedrooms were functional and in use, with beds for each child. Volunteers from the Joy Project continue to mentor and invest in the children of this family.
