Karen has been a long time friend of ours that works at Dunkin Donuts in downtown Lexington. In 2011 her daughterâ€™s life was tragically taken at the young age of 20. When we visited her home in 2012, Karen still lived at the apartment and slept in the same room where her daughter lost her life. We realized that updating furniture in the room would help remove some of the terrible reminders that Karen was living with each day. It was a practical response to a very personal need. We will never forget the vulnerability Karen showed by trusting us with her story.
