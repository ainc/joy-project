This Joy Project recipient has spent her life encouraging kids as a teacher at The Child Development Center of the Bluegrass. After living as a cancer survivor with five years of remission, she was faced with battling stage 5 breast cancer again. Once she began chemotherapy she had to take sick leave from work. Marla endured chemotherapy with amazing courage and strength. Her attitude throughout her grueling treatment was an encouragement to the Joy Project Team. Marla loves camping, but due to her illness and treatment, she was unable to get out and go camping, so we brought the campfire to her! Friends of the Joy Project showered her with gift cards, s'more supplies and a fire pit.  Thank you Marla for being a fighter and an inspiration. We hope the fire pit brings you and your family much joy!
