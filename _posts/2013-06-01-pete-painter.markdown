Pete came to Awesome Inc in 2009 and offered his painting skills as a service to our community.  At the time, Pete was homeless and an alcoholic.  After several years of showing love to Pete (and him showing love back to us), Pete is no longer homeless and is no longer an alcoholic.  He actually hasn’t had a drink in several months.  He’s now a great friend, our go to handyman, and can sing a sweet rendition of “Sittin on the dock of the bay”
