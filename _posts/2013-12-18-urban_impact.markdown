This November, the Joy Project sent seven Lexington students to a leadership development retreat with [Urban Impact](www.lexlf.org/urban-impact/).

To qualify for a scholarship to attend this unique development experience, middle and high school students demonstrated their commitment to service and leadership by attending a service day with the Joy Project. Students devoted an afternoon to cleaning up a local community center and the surrounding neighborhood. They also took the time to think through questions about leadership including “Why is it important to serve the community?”

One student summed up the mission of the Joy Project by stating that serving the community causes others to step up and serve too. We’ve found that a little Joy goes a long way and the effects are continuous. What a privilege to invest in students who feel the same way!
