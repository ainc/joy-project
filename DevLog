		  {% endif %}

		$(window).load(function() {
		    $('.flexslider').flexslider({
		    animation: "fade",
		    controlNav: true,
		    directionNav: true,
		    slideshowSpeed: 5000,
		    animationSpeed: 600,

		 {% if page.carousel %}
		  <div class="flexslider">
		    <ul class="slides">
		      {% for slides in page.carousel %}
		      <li>
		        <img src="{{ slides.image }}">
		      </li>
		      {% endfor %}
		    </ul>
		  </div>
		  {% endif %}
	**** Removed all use of yaml & liquid tags
